Data Description
-----------------------------------
The dataset is a small piece of a long term time-series I-V curves dataset of a full size module traced by ESL-Solar 500. It is over a 5 hour time period from 2013-12-29 09:00:00 to 2013-12-29 13:55:00 with 5 minute time intervals. The two columns are "tmst", which saves the date and time for the measurement in the format of "Year-Month-Date hour:minute:second" and "ivdf", which contains the I-V curve data points in a string format separated by "#" and voltage and current value separated by "*".

Load data and run code 
------------------------------------------
```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(ddiv)
data("IV_timeseries")
```
Example output
--------------------------
The result is extarcted features for example time-series data "IV_timeseries" if using code example in IVfeature or IVExtractResult function.
